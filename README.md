## Recon & Initial Investigation

Upon entering the TryHackMe: Bricks Heist room, I started both the AttackBox and the victim system. After adding the victim's IP to the `/etc/hosts` file, I investigated the webpage at `https://bricks.thm`, confirming it was a WordPress site. I ran a WPScan to identify the WordPress version (1.9.5), which was vulnerable to CVE-2024-25600, leading to the discovery of an exploit on GitHub.

## Exploitation

I downloaded the raw exploit code for the Bricks WordPress vulnerability and ran it using Python. After installing required Python modules (`rich`, `prompt-toolkit`, and `alive-progress`), the exploit successfully ran, confirming the vulnerability was present.

## Exploring Initial Access

After exploiting the vulnerability, I accessed the victim system with Apache privileges. I used a reverse shell to stabilize the connection and discovered a flag in a `.txt` file. Additionally, I identified hard-coded credentials in the `wp-config.php` file, which could potentially be used for further exploitation.

## Identifying the Suspicious Process

Upon checking the systemâ€™s running processes, I identified a suspicious `ubuntu.service` running from the `/lib/NetworkManager/nm-inet-dialog` directory. Investigating the `inet.conf` file, I discovered that it contained logs related to a Bitcoin Miner. This led to identifying the Bitcoin mining operation running on the system.

## Investigating the BTC Address

By decoding an ID found in the Bitcoin Miner logs, I traced the address to a Bitcoin wallet, which was confirmed to be associated with a Bitcoin Miner. Using a website to check the wallet's status, I discovered that the wallet had received and sent BTC and was linked to the LockBit ransomware.

## Conclusion

Through careful reconnaissance, exploitation, and analysis of the system and its processes, I successfully discovered the Bitcoin wallet address and linked it to the LockBit ransomware, completing the TryHackMe: Bricks Heist room.
